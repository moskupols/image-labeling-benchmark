\begin{enumerate}
  \item The references page was revised: references on Kronrod and Fisher-Yates
    were removed, as well the extra number before one of the references on
    Makovetskii and Kober.
  \item In the ``Measurement'' subsection, a paragraph was added clarifying that
    the time overhead of explicitly condensing the image was included in the
    measured time.
